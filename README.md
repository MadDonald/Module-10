# Team Roster Generator

## Description

This is a command line application that takes user input to generate a HTML file that displays a team roster. The user is prompted to enter information for each employee on their team, including their name, ID, email, and role. Depending on the employee's role, they will be asked additional questions (e.g. office number for managers, GitHub username for engineers, etc.). After all employee information has been collected, an HTML file is generated that displays the team roster with each employee's information.

This application was built using Node.js and the Inquirer.js library for collecting user input.
